# Dealing with or
C = A or B

A = x <= a
B = y <= b

Rewritten:
x -(1-A) * BIG <= a
y -(1-B) * BIG <= b
A + B >= 1

# Dealing with and
C = A and B

A = x <= a
B = y <= b

Rewritten:
x -(1-A) * BIG <= a
y -(1-B) * BIG <= b
A + B >= 1

Cases:
- linear equation => leave
- or => rewrite as condition + add constraints
- and => rewrite as condition + add constraints
- not => Invert somehow
